New in SoupGate v1.05/á-2000-11-02

* Added NNTP authentication support to Spoon
  (requested by several people)

* Message-ID & References no longer lowercased
  (requested by several people)

* Added MailinglistOption truncend= to allow the stripping of ads
  from the top of messages

New in SoupGate v1.05/á-2000-04-24

* Fixed Linux version to always use lowercase for all files EXCEPT
  the SOUP files (AREAS, REPLIES, *.MSG) because these are specified
  as being uppercase (hence nothing needed to be changed in Spoon)
  (reported by loads of people)

* Added new MailingListOption to split up the overloaded MailingList
  keyword (for backwards compatibility the old form is still supported)
  (requested by Jose Luis Benitez)

* Added MailingListOption author= option to allow insertion of the
  author name/email when exporting messages.

* Added SmtpSeparateMail option to Spoon for SMTP servers that insist
  on a separate MAIL FROM command for every recipient.
  (requested by Armin Schaefer)

* MSGID/REPLY forced to lowercase
  (requested by Armin Schaefer)

* Added note to documentation explaining the fact that if SoupGate is
  unable to recognize the filename, a file will be decoded as 00000000.ATT
  resp. 00000001.ATT etc.

New in SoupGate v1.05/á-2000-02-16

* Fixed another AddrMap-bug with name translation;
  as a consequence personal messages now only have meaning
  for news (not for e-mail)
  (reported by Vicki Fletcher and others)

* Now adds Errors-To: and Return-Path: headers in hosted mailing
  lists if a KeeperAddress is defined in the list configuration

* Message-IDs generated for hosted mailing lists will now
  contain at most one @ sign
  (requested by Sean Rima)

* Changed SeparateMsg default from No to Yes

* Added short explanation of compressed/uncompressed mail
  configuration in installation section of documentation,
  because apparently some people were getting confused

* The source distribution now includes the folding editor I use
  (DOS application, also runs under Windows, OS/2 or Linux DOSEMU)

New in SoupGate v1.05/á-1999-11-07

NOTE: this beta release is there to fix several serious bugs;
the people who requested new features will need some more
patience.

* Fixed several bugs in ArcMail mode, causing messages
  not to be exported and net/node numbers to be wrong
  (reported by Richard Menedetter, Simon Avery, and
   probably a lot of other people)

* Some mailers apparently insert CR/LF pairs instead
  of only a CR in MSG files; SoupGate now compensates
  for this erroneous behaviour
  (reported by Simon Avery)

* Fixed bug in SoupGate that would cause hosted mailing
  list messages and commands to be processed normally
  even if they were detected as being junk mail; this
  could cause quite an interesting game of virtual tennis
  between SoupGate and "Mail Delivery Subsystem"...

* Fixed bug in SoupGate that caused unwanted quoted-printable
  translation in header fields (e.g. name=34567890.123 became
  name"567890.123)

* For non-existing directories, also prints which keyword is
  associated with it

* Fixed bug in Linux version of SoupGate that caused error 
  messages when TempDir was not defined and the TEMP
  environment variable was not found

* Fixed some serious bugs in the Linux version of Spoon
  (all Spoon versions are now beta, no longer alpha)

* Added an average CPS counter to Spoon

* Removed the message size check from Spoon, because
  several POP3 servers gave incorrect results

* Spoon now deletes messages directly after they are
  fetched from the POP3 server, not in batch anymore
  (requested by Peter Lacus)

* Added option to fetch mail only from certain email
  addresses from the POP3 server in Spoon

* Updated the email address information in the documentation

New in SoupGate v1.05/á-1999-08-04

* At last: Linux support! See soupgate.tgz for included
  glibc2 versions (or download sg105_s.tgz for statically
  linked versions). The default configuration filename etc.
  has been changed to lowercase (Soup and mail files etc.
  have not because they are specified as uppercase).

* The format of the soupgate.dat written in the netmail
  directory if you use an Arcmail-style outbound with
  the QuickScan feature has changed. However, SoupGate
  will automatically replace this file with the new
  format upon the first soupgate export command, and
  the new format has been designed so that should you
  move back to an older version there shouldn't be
  any problems either, so normally you won't need to
  manually delete or modify soupgate.dat.

* Includes Spoon v1.00, a replacement for Souper. Very
  primitive at the moment. Versions available for OS/2,
  Win32 and Linux (glibc2 version included, download
  sp100_s.tgz for a statically linked version).
  WARNING TO THE BETATESTERS: ONLY THE OS/2 VERSION HAS
  BEEN TESTED YET --- the Win32 and Linux versions are
  to be considered ALPHA versions, even though they
  are included in this BETA package. Please report
  your findings with Win32 and Linux.
  A DOS version for Spoon is not available because there
  is no decent standardized TCP/IP interface for DOS.

* Because of Spoon inclusion, removed Souper from archive.

* Reply-To: no longer written if same as From: address
  (requested by Widjoen Pradjitno)

* AreaMap area and newsgroup names are now case insensitive
  (requested by Sean Rima)

* Fixed an out-of-bounds memory access bug that didn't show
  up until the port to linux

New in SoupGate v1.04/â-1999-06-28

NOTE: this gamma release is only an intermediate release.
Development continues, so there should soon be a new beta
release with extra features. So if you find that a feature
you requested is not available in this version, that does
not mean that I am not going to implement it. For updates
about new beta, gamma or release versions, send a message
with subject subscribe to the SoupGate mailing list (hosted
by SoupGate, of course) at soupgate@softhome.net.

* If a message contains a Fidonet address in the MSGID kludge,
  this will now be used as the From address (avoids problems
  with From zone and point addresses with mailers/tossers that
  don't insert correct INTL/FMPT/TOPT kludges); this should fix
  some of the earlier reported problems with AddrMap!

* Will now recognize the KFS (kill file/sent) and TFS (truncate
  file/sent) in the FLAGS kludge, causing ArcMail file attaches
  to be properly removed or truncated even if they are not preceded
  by ^ or #
  (requested by Jonathan Gijsen)

* Added definable Reply-To to AddrMap
  (requested by Richard Menedetter)

* Organization line no longer changed when echoing back mail messages
  for hosted mailing lists; instead added X-MailListOrg: header;
  of course this only applies if there was an organization present,
  e.g. to allow own organization detection by another SoupGate
  (requested by Richard Menedetter)

* Mailing lists (both MailList and ListConfig) will now
  use the QuoteTo feature as well as news

* E-mail addresses in To: field for mailing lists will no
  longer cause the mail to be sent out to both the mailing
  list address and this e-mail address

* MailList-configured mailing lists will now also include
  an X-Comment-To: header containing the recipient's name

* Added template name to "+ reply" entry in log file

* The QuoteChar keyword now allows for a specified number
  of initials to precede the quote character

* File attaches from junk mail no longer decoded

* MIME quoted-printable encoded 0 bytes (=00) will be replaced
  by spaces; they confuse tossers (and a double 0 aborts the
  packet)

* When splitting lines for exporting, whitespace will be
  preferred now; only if that's not available, other
  characters will be used to split on
  (requested by Per Riber)

* Added IMPORT/EXPORT option to CharSetMap to allow the
  conversion to happen only in a specified direction
  (requested by Peter Lacus)

* When decoding UU/MIME files, instead of overwriting existing
  files will now automatically rename the file (no human
  intervention required)
  (requested by Peter Lacus)

* UU/MIME filenames may now contain a *, in which case they will
  automatically be renamed to a unique filename (the extension will
  be kept if that is specified)
  (requested by Jonathan Gijsen)

* UU-decoding now supports long filenames containing spaces
  (requested by Catalin T. Bradu)

* Non-existing subdirectories in the configuration file
  will now cause a fatal error and abort
  (requested by Jan Hoolwerf)

* Fixed bug that could cause messages to be corrupted when
  a certain date format was used in a message

* Fixed bug in list packing code causing spurious errors
  and corrected line numbers in error messages

* Fixed bug with killing and truncating file attaches, which
  also could cause long junk filenames to be written into the
  current directory (so if you have these, you can stop worrying
  about what was causing them and simply delete them)

New in SoupGate v1.04/á-1999-04-27

* Added TransFidoOrg conversion on import for To: addresses
  (requested by Sean Rima)

* Added < > brackets to BCC: addresses in mailing list,
  because apparently some SMTP servers otherwise have
  problems with multiple addresses
  (reported by Richard Menedetter)

* Fixed bug with EmailArea, OwnOrgArea and JunkArea causing
  the defaults to be used when recursive configuration files
  were used
  (reported by Richard Menedetter)

* Fixed bug introduced in previous beta causing file attach
  subjects to be messed up

* HeaderInfo's insert option no longer adds any From or To
  information if it already detects a From: or To: line
  present (possibly added by e.g. mailing list software)

* Extended StripKludges keyword so it's much more flexible

* Since newer versions of FMail also support uncompressed mail,
  modified the statement about FMail in the setup section
  (reported by Jan Hoolwerf)

* Added ;SUBJ: option to MailingList TRUNCATE= keyword, allowing
  to remove a substring from the subject

* Spaces at the end of a line in the configuration file are
  no longer stripped off, but are retained.

New in SoupGate v1.04/á-1999-03-20

* Now supports setting up your own mailing list!
  (See chapter "Mailing list configuration" in documentation)

* The SoupGate mailing list serves both as a test of this new
  feature of SoupGate and as a support forum. To subscribe to
  this mailing list, send an e-mail to soupgate@softhome.net
  with subject "subscribe" (without the quotes).

* Now includes (still tiny) BOUNCE.CFG to intercept email
  bounces. This file should still grow.

* Added TRUNCATE= option to MailingList keyword, allowing to
  remove ads etc. from mailing lists

* Added SOUPGATE PACK (short: P) and SOUPGATE CHECK (short: C)
  to the command line options

* Added weekday into date field; although specified as optional
  in RFC822 some servers apparently require it; also changed
  from 2-digit to 4-digit year form
  (reported by Ales Filip & Peter Lacus)

* Fixed bug in UU-decoding routines when lines end in whitespace
  (reported by Catalin T. Bradu)

* Added /GLOBAL (or /G for short) command line option that
  allows statistics to be displayed only once at the end
  (requested by Richard Menedetter)

* Added KillOrigin keyword that allows to suppress tearline & origin
  (requested by Richard Menedetter)

* Added support for BCopy: for Bcc: (blind carbon copy)
  (requested by Richard Menedetter)

* Some Cc:'s were not translated to Copy: lines on importing
  (reported by Richard Menedetter)

* Fixed bug in Copy to Cc: translation on exporting
  (reported by Richard Menedetter)

* Only one blank line inserted at start of message after
  inserted information, not between every line of information

* Now always puts Xpost: before the other information (From, To, ...)

* Added LineWidth option to configure the line width for exported
  messages instead of always 72
  (requested by Tommi Koivula)

* Added SeparateMSG keyword allowing all exported messages to
  be in a single Soup MSG file (allows for better error recovery
  with programs like Souper etc.)

* Much better error recovery for corrupted Soup files; an error message
  will be printed (and logged) and the files will be renamed to *.BAD

* Fixed bug in JunkCategory causing junk mail detection on categories
  where it should not have been detecting

* Made explicit in doc that CharSetMap works in both directions
  (requested by Peter Lacus)

* Removed description of non-existing Decompress keyword from doc

* Uses newer version of PMODE/W (old version caused problems on at
  least one system)
  (reported by Patrick Elsaesser)

New in SoupGate v1.03/â-1999-02-04

* Added HeaderInfo option to chose whether name or e-mail address
  is put in header and/or inserted into message body
  (requested by Richard Menedetter)

* Added option to configure default character set (previously us-ascii
  was used when no corresponding CharSetMap could be found)
  (requested by Richard Menedetter)

* Fixed minor bug in QuoteTo feature, which mistook quotemasks at end
  of message for quotemasks at beginning of quote

New in SoupGate v1.03/á-1999-01-03

* Several problems fixed in exporting of PKT files attached to
  messages, especially with the ArcMail style outbound
  (requested by Richard Menedetter)

* AddrMap translation problems fixed
  (reported by Andre Grueneberg, Kari Suomela, Pedro Cardoso, Sean Rima,
   and I'm probably forgetting some more people...)

* empty messages without files attached are no longer exported

* messages without a CHRS kludge now correctly default to us-ascii
  (reported by Peter Lacus)

* fixed problem that sometimes caused 8bit/quoted-printable when only
  7bit characters were used

* maxzone for FidoDomain now optional (as was described in doc)

* all commandline options can now be abbreviated
  (requested by Richard Menedetter)

New in SoupGate v1.03/á-1998-12-27

* DOS executable is now bound with PMODE/W extender because
  of segment overflow; this also means SoupGate can't run on
  286 and below anymore

* Added support for charset<->CHRS translation
  (requested by Peter Lacus)

* Allows exporting of all packets (*.PKT) addressed to the
  gateway or a route node in a specified directory using the
  /PKT=<dir> commandline option; this is useful if you have a
  tosser that does not support uncompressed mail (see included
  COMPREXP.BAT)
  (requested by Peter Lacus)

* Fixed bug causing JunkStr keyword not working properly
  (reported by Patrick Elsaesser)

* Mailing lists now also filtered on Sender and X-From headers
  (requested by Egor Duda)

* Introduced FidoDomain keyword that allows using other
  domains than fidonet.org for auto-mapping of addresses
  and Message-IDs
  (requested by Andre Grueneberg)

* Fixed bug in fidonet.org message-IDs for points, where a
  dot was omitted between p# and f#
  (reported by Andre Grueneberg)

* Fixed problem with SEEN-BYs in mailing lists

* Fixed problem that could turn the MSGID sequential number
  into a negative value when converted to an ifmail-style
  decimal message-ID

* Added 'junk' option for JunkAction and OwnOrgAction, which
  extends 'move' to set the To: field to JunkMail (useful to
  get around the problem of some tossers forwarding personal
  mail from the junk mail area)

* Own organization messages will now contain JUNKMAIL kludge
  (and possibly JUNKMAIL-TO) as well, and their count will no
  longer be identified as "archives:" but as "own org:" (the
  former could be too easily confused with archives in the sense
  of compressed mail files).

* Fixed bug that sometimes caused whitespace to be included
  in the Newsgroups: line when crossposted messages were
  exported, causing problems while posting

* Made clear that parameters in configuration file must be
  separated by spaces, not ^I tabs
  (reported by Andre Grueneberg)

* Fixed erroneous URL listed in doc file

New in SoupGate v1.02/â-1998-11-04

* Junk mail detection can now be categorized for email and/or
  news
  
* JunkStr strings can now also be checked in news subject
  (not in message body)

* Extended AddrMap keyword features:
  - can now select From emailaddress depending on From name
  - takes over Personal functionality

* Personal keyword now obsolete because of AddrMap extensions

* Fixed bug in automatic From-address translation while exporting
  (reported by Kari Suomela)

* Fixed bugs in PATH and SEEN-BY lines introduced in v1.01
  (reported by Sean Rima)

* Now removes Pvt flag for mailing lists
  (reported by Sean Rima)

* Fixed bugs in To/From name processing while importing

* Updated message-ID translation info in DOC as well
  as incorrect version number on top (oops)

New in SoupGate v1.01/B-1998-09-12

* Bugfix version for SoupGate v1.01/release

* Fixed bug in MIME encoding routines with an extra padding
  byte; most decoders didn't notice but e.g. Pine would give
  an "internal base64 decoder error"

* Now always adds INTL line instead of only for inter-zone
  netmail, as some tossers (e.g. FastEcho) would show the
  originating zone as 0 during the tossing process

New in SoupGate v1.01/R-1998-09-01

* First non-gamma release; SoupGate seems to have proved that
  it has reached a certain stability by now

* Direct mail (DUT/DLO) will now be exported as well; also added
  ExportAllMail option to export mail on hold as well
  (requested by Pedro Cardoso)

* Added DecodeDir ... ALL option to decode files attached to emails
  in that directory as well instead of in the inbound directory
  WARNING: this may cause problems with your tosser, use with care!
  (requested by Pedro Cardoso)

* Added TransFidoOrg keyword to auto-translate fidonet.org addresses
  to the corresponding fidonet addresses when importing

* Improved QuoteTo routines which would sometimes fill in
  incorrect To-names for newsgroups

* When no Origin is specified and Organization line is empty or
  not present, the From-address will now be used.

* Files decoded from IgnoreMessageText-messages will now also display
  information and correctly update the file counter

New in SoupGate v1.01/â-1998-08-29

* Fixed some bugs in the PKT encoding that would cause serious
  problems on some tossers (e.g. Squish)
  (reported by Pedro Cardoso)

* Added UseQP option that allows to disable quoted-printable
  encoding for 8-bit characters
  (requested by Serge Wizgounoff & Max Alekseyev)

* Added optional From: line that can be inserted in messages
  that are sent to the gateway for exporting, which allows
  users to receive replies to their own email-address.
  (requested by Kari Suomela)

* QuoteTo feature to determine To: name in newsgroups from
  quote template re-supported. QuoteChar and QuoteMask keywords
  added to allow configuration of the QuoteTo feature.

* Added SUBJ=<subj> option to the Route keyword, which allows
  to set the subject for mail transports (for compability
  with programs like e.g. IREX).

* Multiple To/CC-addresses now supported also for importing;
  all these addresses will be used for mail filtering

* Will now use Reply-To field for REPLYADDR if present; this
  address will also be used for mail filtering

* Added IgnoreMessageText keyword to allow routing-messages to
  be ignored while the files attached to them are decoded

* Added JunkGroup keyword that allows to filter out junk mail
  based on the newsgroups a message is (cross-)posted in

* The sample junk mail configuration files (JUNK*.CFG) are now
  included -- use at your own discretion.

* Personal mail is no longer forwarded from mailing lists

* In the import status report, added information about the number
  of personal messages, decoded files and ignored-text messages

* Added /VERBOSE command line option to display from/to information
  for every imported e-mail and every exported e-mail/news message

* TEMP environment variable can be overridden with new keyword TempDir

* Fixed bug that incorrectly reported junkmail filtered out by the
  JunkFromTo keyword as JUNKMAIL: FROM.

* Fixed minor bugs in e-mail address parsing and mailinglist substring
  matching code

* Fixed hidden memory allocation bug

* Added contact addresses to beginning of doc file

* Included PKTVIEW utility to verify PKT files

New in SoupGate v1.00/â-1998-04-03.

* First public gamma version release

New in SoupGate v1.00/á-1998-03-28.

* Fixed bug that caused the start of some message bodies to be
  incorrectly interpreted as header information

New in SoupGate v1.00/á-1998-03-14.

* Fixed serious bug in MIME decoding: some files (e.g. those
  encoded using Microsoft Outlook Express) would be truncated
  to 0 bytes

* Bug in new MailingList parameter fixed

* SoupGate now allows to split large PKTs, as some tossers
  would choke on them (not mine, obviously)

* SoupGate now allows to address replies to certain messages in
  newsgroups to a predefined name, which may then in turn be
  forwarded to a special personal mail area by another program,
  e.g. a mail tosser. For that purpose the Redirect keyword
  has been replaced with the Personal keyword.

* Bug in Internet->Fido MSGID/REPLY conversion fixed

* SoupGate now removes the "end" line after it has decoded
  a UUencoded file as well

New in SoupGate v1.00/á-1998-03-07.

* Mailinglists that did not have an export email from-address defined
  would put all kinds of garbage in the from and reply-to addresses
  of the exported messages

New in SoupGate v1.00/á-1998-01-18:

* Bink-outbound only: files inside flow files with no corresponding
  mail packet will now be sent as well - for Route-nodes only
  (allows for routing compressed mail to nodes)

* Messages containing no non-ASCII characters will be
  encoded using 7bit encoding instead of quoted-printable

* Bink-outbound only: PKT files inside flow-files where not
  deleted after they were sent, even in non-test mode
  [so if you've used these, e.g. a binkley + fastecho
  combination like over here, you may have to clean
  out "some" PKT files from your outbound directory]

* Messages for mailinglists won't be checked for junkmail anymore

* When Kill was set for JunkAction or OwnOrgAction, the rest of
  the message file was ignored as well

* Domain keyword removed; Message-ID uses fidonet.org domain
  and should now be sort of ifmail-compatible

* QuoteTo template recognizing removed; it caused much more
  trouble than it was worth (it might be re-implemented from
  scratch later, when all the rest works like it should)

* XPost feature fixed; Souper did not like the Newsgroups: header
  to be spread across several lines

* No longer assumes anything containing Newsgroups: is news

* Last reference in list is now used for ReplyID instead of first;
  this allows for much better reply-linking

* MIME encoding now uses 76 characters per line instead of 72

* You can now define an optional from-address for mailinglists
  (requested by Sean Rima)

* Some more statistics about the imported messages added
  (# of email, news, mailinglists and junk mail messages)
