Hello @YOURNAME@!

Someone (hopefully you) wishes to subscribe or unsubscribe
you to/from @LISTNAME@ with address
@YOURADDRESS@.

If this is what you intend, send an e-mail to
@LISTADDRESS@ with subject "subscribe @PASSWORD@"
or "unsubscribe @PASSWORD@" (without the quotes)
depending on the action you wish to take.

The @PASSWORD@ is your password which you will also need to
unsubscribe later.

If you forgot your password, just send "subscribe" or
"unsubscribe" without the password and this message
containing your password will be mailed to you. This
way other people are prevented from subscribing or
unsubscribing you against your will.

You can change your password by sending an e-mail to
@LISTADDRESS@ with subject "changepass oldpass newpass"
where oldpass is your old password (currently @PASSWORD@)
and newpass is your new password. Passwords may not
contain any spaces. Passwords are case sensitive, so
uppercase letters are different from lowercase letters.

greetings,
@KEEPERNAME@
@KEEPERADDRESS@
